# Craig Anderson — CV

I’m a back end web developer with over 17 years of experience looking for my first contracting role. I’m interested in contracting as it should, in time, give me more flexibility to move as my partner’s academic career demands. I’m a strong proponent for test-driven development, and am motivated by work for social good.

### Bachelor of Applied Science (Computer Science), RMIT University (1997–1999)

[^abc3-rebrand]: The ABC have since re-branded ABC3 as ABC ME, and ABC3 RAWR as ABC ME Your Films.

[^footy-tipping]: “Footy Tipping” is popular in many Australian social groups. It’s a competition conducted over a football season where each competitor attempts to guess (or “tip”) the winner of each week’s matches. Scores are updated weekly, and the winner is the person who tipped the most correct matches during the season. There’s usually a small cash prize involved, but gambling isn’t the main motivation.
